This is a public repository for a prototype cubical proof assistant. The type theory is a two level type theory with a cubical "inner" layer and an "outer" layer which validates uniqueness of identity proofs. The cubical layer currently includes extension and partial types and systems. 

see notes.pdf for operational semantics
